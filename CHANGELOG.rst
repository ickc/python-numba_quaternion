Revision history for ``numba_quaternion``
=========================================

-  v0.2.0: all quaternion array is now complex to avoid excessive conversion. The Quaternion class is a bit different because of this. Use ``Quaternion.from_array`` to create from real array.
-  v0.1.0: first release and proof of concept.
